# xs - an extra small game engine

xs is an experiment into making the smallest game making tool possible. It can also be a tool to teach introduction to programming for game developers, who might not necessarily be programmers.
- xs uses the [Wren](https://wren.io/) scripting language for gameplay, and C++ for the backend
- xs uses 2D rendering and is best suited for pixel-perfect sprite graphics
- xs has basic audio support (using Fmod) for playing sound effects and background music
- xs can be built for PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5
- xs has no graphical interface beyond the reload script and pause/play buttons
- xs is in a very early alpha (but open for contribution from anyone at games@buas)
